<h3 style="text-align:center;">What are we doing?</h3>

One of our main priorities is to keep the population well informed and update them on every step of the construction, including the plans for the nearest future. We distribute flyers and posters, collect signatures for cancelling the pro stadium decision. We also maintain the growing online community to get as much support as possible, engaging people from all over Russia and the rest of the world. We interact with the authorities in order to convince them this construction site is a horrible idea that would bring irreversible damage to the park and the city itself. We organize protests and 24/7 duty shifts in order to physically protect the forest from destruction.

//Briefly describe what exactly you are doing. There is no need to post all information about your projects and programs here, make a short statement. If your city protection group has victories tell us about them and give hyperlinks to publications in the media about it. People join those who know how to achieve small goals. The protection of the park is a victory, the action against construction is another one.
