Activists of the Pervomaisky District, together with the public organization "Ecologists of Dvoegorsk", released a brochure "Park Dubrovino: the lungs of our city. 

The brochure contains arguments on why the park is vital for the city’s ecological environment, as well as memos to the residents on what can be done to prevent the deforestation and leaflets samples for distribution. 

> We have drawn designers and illustrators into work so that everyone can clearly understand why the city cannot live on without Dubrovino Park. Can a person live without lungs? No. Why did someone decide that the stadium and the deforestation would not cause any harm or damage? Ecologists and geographers of the Department of Ecology and Nature Management of Dvoyegorsk State University presented a scientific reasons why the landscape of the entire park falls into a protected zone and needs protection. 

The brochures will be available at the headquarters of “Ecologists of Dvoegorsk”, and also during public events supporting the cause. The PDF version can be found online here (link).

Total circulation of the brochure - **3 000 copies**.
