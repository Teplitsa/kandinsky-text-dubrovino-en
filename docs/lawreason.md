To understand the reason why we consider this construction illegal, we have asked a notorious city defender **Anatoly Neboskrebov**, and hereâ€™s what he has to say.

> Excuse me, gentlemen. If everything was so simple, we would not be able to enjoy the views of the Vinogradovs' estate of the 18th century or the Church of St. Benedict, located in the Kholmogory valley. What kind of protection do these cultural monuments have? They are protected by the Land Use and Development Rules. It is a tool for urban planning. It looks at the city under a microscope, carefully examines every street and every square and does not allow to demolish or destroy what is not supposed to. 

According to our Land Use and Development Rules Dubrovino Park is a **recreational natural zone**. Its borders cannot be illegally violated out of nowhere hence a sports and entertainment facility, which is a stadium, cannot be built. There is no such thing. Who issued the building permit? Who signed the documents with the investor? Why did this someone decide that no one would notice such barbarity? No answer. What the residents of Pervomaisky District are doing deserves a praise. Keep fighting. You have all the arguments to win.
