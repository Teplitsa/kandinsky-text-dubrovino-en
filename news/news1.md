The first public hearing of the project regarding the territory in Dubrovino park, Pervomaisky district, will take place on June 15, 2017. According to this project, it is planned to build a football stadium, which will entail the cutting of over 300 trees and the loss of 4 hectares of forest.

Public hearings are one of the few ways to influence a new project. Follow the links below to find out more.

The residents of the district have created an initiative group led by the city rights activist Sergey Viktorovich Topolev. They are preparing questions for the planners with the backup of best city lawyers.

If you donâ€™t want the remains of the park to be filled with football fans, their ridiculously loud chanting and occasional violent behavior, you should definitely attend the hearings.

The hearings will be held at Ryabinin street, 5 known as "The House of Poetry". The official beginning is at 19:00, registration will start at 18:00. It is advisable to arrive early.
