Dubrovino Park protectors came up to the Pervomaisky District Administration on May 14, 2017 passing 20,000 signatures against the unlawful construction in the middle of the natural zone. Over 100 people participated.

Among the appeals sent to the Administration were:

1. 17838 petition signatures.
2. 2008 residents’ signatures of Pervomaisky district against deforestation and the construction of a sports stadium there.
3. 432 appeals personally to the head of the Administration Demyanov Yuli Arkadievich.

We oppose the construction of the stadium, because it demands the demolition of Dubrovino Park, which is a protected recreational zone, and the natural environment in the area will significantly deteriorate.
