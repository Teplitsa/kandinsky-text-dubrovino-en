Our goal is to stop the unlawful deforestation of Dubrovino park, a recreational natural zone in a small town of Dvoegorsk, Pervomaisky District.
We started off as a handful of activists back in March 2017, and as of now we have over **75 people** actively engaged. 

//The name of your initiative should reflect the essence of the problem you are going to solve: protecting the park, stopping construction, protecting a cultural site. Write your headline so that everyone who reads it will immediately understand what you are doing.
