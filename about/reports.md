Our initiative is supported by the people of Dvoegorsk, who are passionate about their hometown and want to preserve itâ€™s natural zone. It enables the much needed spread of awareness, publishing, official correspondence with the authorities and consultations with top lawyers.

There are multiple volunteer groups who are constantly monitoring the situation and are always ready to resist the ongoing illegal actions of the local government.

All of our spendings have been documented since the establishment of the organisation in 2017. We make sure our monthly reports are accessible to the public:

* Report from March 2017
* Report from April 2017
* Report from May 2017
* Report from June 2017
* Report from July 2017
* Report from August 2017
