<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the issue? </h3>
 
On March 15, 2017 the Administration of Dvoegorsk made a decision to build a football stadium right in the middle of the park of Dubrovino.

> “Every day I take my dog for a walk in the park, like many of my neighbours. One evening I noticed some people who looked concerned and as it turned out they were discussing the upcoming construction of a huge stadium that was supposed to begin really soon, and I couldn’t believe it. I looked at the blooming fields surrounded by towering oaks, I saw my playful dog Jeff running around in the grass...and it broke my heart to think they would take this away from us and replace this quiet piece of nature with yet another concrete monstrosity. Yelling football fans everywhere... This can’t be. We won’t let it happen”
